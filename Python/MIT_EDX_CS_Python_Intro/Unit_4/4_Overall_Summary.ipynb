    "## Section 1: Testing\n",
    "Testing is a systematic approach to checking if your program behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Unit Testing\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Test individual components, like functions or methods, in isolation.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Write test cases for each function.\n",
    "  - Run these tests after any change to ensure functionality.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - For a function `multiply(x, y)`, test with positive numbers, negative numbers, and zeros.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "        return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12  # Standard case\n",
    "    assert multiply(-1, 4) == -4  # Negative number\n",
    "    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0    # Zero multiplication\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Regression Testing\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensure that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing features.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Re-run previous tests after any code update.\n",
    "  - Automate these tests for efficiency.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - After adding a new feature to a calculator app, re-run tests for existing functions like addition, subtraction, etc., to ensure they still work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Integration Testing\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Test the interaction between different parts of the software.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Combine individual units and test them as a whole.\n",
    "  - Check for interface errors and data flow issues.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - In a web application, test how the front-end communicates with the back-end database after a user action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Debugging\n",
    "Debugging is about identifying, isolating, and correcting faults in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Steps in Debugging\n",
    "- **Identification**: Recognize that there is a problem.\n",
    "  - Use test results or user feedback to detect anomalies.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Narrow down the cause of the issue.\n",
    "  - Use print statements, logging, or interactive debugging tools to inspect program state.\n",
    "- **Resolution**: Apply a fix to the identified issue.\n",
    "  - Modify the code to rectify the bug.\n",
    "  - Consider potential side effects of the fix.\n",
    "- **Verification**: Confirm that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new bugs.\n",
    "  - Re-run tests and check if the application now behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Systematic Debugging Techniques\n",
    "- **Print Debugging**:\n",
    "  - Insert print statements to display values of variables at critical points.\n",
    "- **Interactive Debugging**:\n",
    "  - Use debugging tools to step through code, inspect variable values, and understand the flow.\n",
    "- **Bisection Method**:\n",
    "  - Place a print statement in the middle of the suspect area.\n",
    "  - Depending on the output, move the print statement up or down to zero in on the exact bug location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Print Debugging:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_max(numbers):\n",
    "    max_num = numbers[0]  # Assume first number is max\n",
    "    for num in numbers:\n",
    "        if num > max_num:\n",
    "            max_num = num\n",
    "            print(f\"New max found: {max_num}\")  # Print statement for debugging\n",
    "    return max_num\n",
    "\n",
    "print(find_max([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]))  # Example usage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In-depth testing and debugging are fundamental to the development of reliable, robust software. Through methods like unit testing, regression testing, integration testing, and systematic debugging, programmers can ensure that their code not only meets the required specifications but also gracefully handles unexpected situations or changes.\n",

    "### 3.1 Exceptions\n",
    "Exceptions are mechanisms for handling errors and other extraordinary situations in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 Try-Except Block\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To catch and manage exceptions that may cause the program to crash.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Enclose risky code that might throw an exception in a `try` block.\n",
    "  - Handle specific exceptions in `except` blocks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### 3.1.1 Basic Exception Handling\n",
    "- **Simple Example**: Catching a division by zero error.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Attempted to divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Multiple Exceptions**: Different exceptions for various error types.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code that may raise different exceptions\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 Advanced Exception Handling\n",
    "- **Nested Try-Except Blocks**: Handling exceptions in a more complex code structure.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Outer operation that may fail\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            # Inner operation that may fail\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "        except SomeInnerError as e:\n",
    "            # Handle inner error\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "    except SomeOuterError as e:\n",
    "        # Handle outer error\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reraising Exceptions**: Propagating exceptions up the call stack.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Some risky operation\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    except SomeError as e:\n",
    "        print(\"Handling error and reraising\")\n",
    "        raise  # Reraises the caught exception\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 Types of Exceptions\n",
    "- **Common Exceptions**:\n",
    "- **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "  - Example: Converting a non-numeric string to an integer.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        int(\"not_a_number\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid integer string.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IndexError**: Occurs when trying to access an index outside the range of a list or tuple.\n",
    "  - Example: Accessing a non-existent index in a list.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        print(my_list[3])  # IndexError, as index 3 doesn't exist\n",
    "    except IndexError:\n",
    "        print(\"Index out of range.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "  - Example: Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        print(my_dict[\"c\"])  # KeyError, as key \"c\" doesn't exist\n",
    "    except KeyError:\n",
    "        print(\"Key not found in dictionary.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TypeError**: Occurs when an operation is performed on an inappropriate type.\n",
    "  - Example: Adding a string to an integer.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 5 + \"five\"\n",
    "    except TypeError:\n",
    "        print(\"Incompatible types for addition.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IOError**: Related to input/output operations, like file handling errors.\n",
    "  - Example: Trying to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open('missing_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "            content = file.read()\n",
    "    except IOError:\n",
    "        print(\"File operation failed.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ZeroDivisionError**: Attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "  - Example: Dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    " - **Creating Custom Exceptions**: Custom exceptions are derived from the base `Exception` class.\n",
    "  - Example: Defining a custom exception for specific application errors.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Custom exception for specific error conditions.\"\"\"\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function(value):\n",
    "        if value < 0:\n",
    "            raise CustomError(\"Negative value not allowed\")\n",
    "        # Further processing\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Custom Exceptions**: Custom exceptions can be used to indicate specific error conditions.\n",
    "  - Example: Raising and catching a custom exception.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        my_function(-5)\n",
    "    except CustomError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement in Python is used to trigger an exception manually. When you use `raise`, you're essentially instructing the program to interrupt its current flow and to generate an exception — either a built-in exception or a custom one that you've defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how `raise` works, using your example `raise Exception(\"0\")`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Triggering the Exception**:\n",
    "   - `raise` tells Python to generate an exception at that point in the program.\n",
    "   - `Exception` is a built-in base class for all exceptions in Python. You can use it directly or extend it to create custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Passing an Argument**:\n",
    "   - `\"0\"` is an argument passed to the `Exception` class. This argument is typically a string that describes the error or provides additional information about it.\n",
    "   - When the exception is caught or unhandled, this message can be accessed or displayed, providing insights into why the exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flow of Control**:\n",
    "   - Upon encountering the `raise` statement, Python immediately stops executing the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "   - It then looks for an `except` block that can handle the raised exception. If it finds one, the code within that `except` block is executed.\n",
    "   - If no suitable `except` block is found (either in the current function or in the calling functions up the call stack), the program terminates, and Python will output the error message along with the traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(value):\n",
    "    if value == 0:\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"0 is not a valid value\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Processing value {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_function(0)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "- The function `my_function` checks if the input value is 0. If it is, it raises an `Exception` with the message `\"0 is not a valid value\"`.\n",
    "- In the `try` block, `my_function(0)` is called, which triggers the exception.\n",
    "- The `except` block catches the exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `raise` is a powerful way to ensure that your program behaves in predictable ways and to prevent it from continuing in an erroneous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Assertions\n",
    "Assertions are statements used to assert that a certain condition is true. If the condition is false, the program will raise an `AssertionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 Using Assertions\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To quickly catch bugs by stopping the program if a condition is false.\n",
    "- **Best Practices**:\n",
    "  - Use assertions to check for conditions that should never occur.\n",
    "  - Do not use assertions for data validation or catching expected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 Basic Assertions\n",
    "- **Simple Check**: Ensuring a variable holds a positive value.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = -10\n",
    "    assert x > 0, \"x should be positive\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertion in Functions**: Validating function arguments.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def square_root(value):\n",
    "        assert value >= 0, \"Cannot take the square root of a negative number\"\n",
    "        return value ** 0.5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2 Complex Assertions\n",
    "- **Assertions with Data Structures**: Ensuring the integrity of a data structure.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def process_data(data):\n",
    "        assert all(isinstance(item, int) for item in data), \"All items must be integers\"\n",
    "        # Further processing\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertion in Control Flow**: Using assertions to check state before critical operations.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if condition_met:\n",
    "        # Some critical operation\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        assert False, \"Critical condition not met\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Exception Handling in Real-World Scenarios\n",
    "- **File Handling**: Ensuring files are handled correctly.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "            content = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Operations**: Handling network-related errors like timeouts or connection issues.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code to make network request\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    except TimeoutError:\n",
    "        print(\"Network request timed out.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Defensive Programming\n",
    "- **Anticipating Problems**: Write code to handle unexpected states and inputs gracefully.\n",
    "- **Assertions for Pre-conditions**: Use assertions at the start of functions to ensure valid inputs.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling Strategies**:\n",
    "  - Catch known error types and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "  - Use a general `except` block for unexpected errors, but avoid overusing it to mask problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Comprehensive Exception Handling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = complex_operation()\n",
    "except KnownErrorType as e:\n",
    "    handle_known_error(e)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    log_unexpected_error(e)\n",
    "    raise  # Re-raise the exception to avoid silently masking it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Understanding and implementing exceptions and assertions are fundamental to creating robust and error-resistant Python programs. By effectively using these tools, programmers can prevent many runtime errors and ensure that their code behaves predictably even under unexpected conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "These expanded notes offer a more in-depth look at Exceptions and Assertions, key concepts in ensuring the robustness and reliability of programming projects.\n",

    "## Section 3: Black Box and Glass Box Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Different perspectives on testing for verifying program functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Black Box Testing\n",
    "Testing based on specifications without considering the internal workings of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus**: Exclusively on the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "- **Example**: Testing a function `is_bigger(x, y)` based on expected output for various inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Glass Box Testing (White Box Testing)\n",
    "Testing that involves knowledge of the internal structures of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus**: On the internal logic and pathways of the code.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - For a function with a conditional branch, create test cases to execute each branch.\n",
    "  - For loops: Test with no iteration, one iteration, and multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, and Assertions are crucial for robust programming.\n",
    "- Black Box and Glass Box testing provide comprehensive coverage of program functionality.\n",
